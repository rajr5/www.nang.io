title: "Rackspace"
---

I started at Rackspace after graduating from the University of Wisconsin - Madison. I joined the
OnMetal team, building a brand new service that would securely provision bare metal servers using
the same interface customers would use to provision virtual machines. These bare metal servers had
huge performance gains over virtual machines and were provisioned in a few minutes, compared to
a few days like Rackspace's dedicated servers. I joined shortly after the team was formed to create
this new product from scratch.

To build the product and integrate it successfully with the rest of the organization, we based our
software off [OpenStack Ironic](https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Ironic, which was being used to bootstrap OpenStack private clouds.
