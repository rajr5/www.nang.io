        "I was the first engineering hire. In the first 3 months, I helped migrate our backend to Mongo and NodeJS from Parse & a hosted HIPAA DB. I led the team to build a community feature in our app for supporting your peers, rewrote our native apps in React Native to increase iteration speed, and adding interest-based groups to our community. During a hackweek, I built a display that shows random patients' reasons for getting sober to remind our team why we do what we do. I've worked with React, React Native, NodeJS, iOS & Swift, Android & Java, Mongo, Ansible & AWS to build product features."
