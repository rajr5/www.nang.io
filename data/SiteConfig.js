I'm always forgetting to text my mom when I get home from driving long distance, so I decided to make a simple app to make both our lives easier. The app allows you to set up a location you're heading to and a list of contacts to text when you arrive safely. It tracks your location in the background and then uses Twilio to send a message when you get close to the location.",

During a hackweek, I built a display that shows random patients' reasons for getting sober to remind our team why we do what we do.
