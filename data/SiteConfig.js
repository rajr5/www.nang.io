I'm always forgetting to text my mom when I get home from driving long distance, so I decided to make a simple app to make both our lives easier. The app allows you to set up a location you're heading to and a list of contacts to text when you arrive safely. It tracks your location in the background and then uses Twilio to send a message when you get close to the location.",

        Laboratory migrate two Flash apps to React. We were able to migrate the apps ahead of schedule.
        I built a feature, the bottleneck map, which involved displaying tens of thousands of continuously
        updating shapes on a Leaflet map. I was able to optimize the Redux data store and the way we were
        using React to make this smooth and performant. I also took lead adding some new, complex features
        to the second app in time for a demo to a new client, which was delivered on time and worked as
        the client expected.`

During a hackweek, I built a display that shows random patients' reasons for getting sober to remind our team why we do what we do.
